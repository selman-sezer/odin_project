    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These braised short ribs are pretty much foolproof. As long as two things happen, you are in for some very fine eats. First, the beef must be really well browned — I'm talking deep, dark, crusty, and caramelized. The other key step is easier. Just braise them until they're fork-tender. To paraphrase an expression, 'stick a fork in them, they're done.' After browning properly, the only way to mess these up is to undercook them, so don't.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into ½-inch pieces</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds beef short ribs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves stripped</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer crisped bacon with a slotted spoon to a Dutch oven. Keep bacon drippings in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Generously season short ribs with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Heat bacon drippings in the skillet over high heat. Cook short ribs in hot drippings until browned and caramelized on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer ribs to a Dutch oven, reserving drippings in the skillet. Add thyme and bay leaf to the Dutch oven. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook and stir onion in the skillet until soft and golden, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour into onion mixture and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 1 to 3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
